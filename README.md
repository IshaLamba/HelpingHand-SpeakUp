This application is emphasis on blind persons health issues. Blindness occurs due to some disease , accident or other reasons.
Visual impairment may cause people difficulties with normal daily life tasks such as calling, messaging, call a chemist, call to particular

### Concept 
An App to aid the Visually impaired persons and help them in Medical Emergency Conditions. 
This app will run as an Emergency SOS App service Used in case of emergency by the visually impaired people as such emergency service app for blinds has not been introduced in android playstore yet.
The app will be running as a service and will run mostly based upon gestures and motion sensing, helping it to the most for the blinds.
We will provide a system that is able to send the personâ€™s location to a emergency Contact just by the shake of the device.
On the long pressing for about 10 seconds after shaking the device, the nearby ambulance service will be called.
In Addition to this, this app can also be used to perform various day to day tasks like calling and sending text messages to contacts as well as to numbers by simply using the voice commands from the user.
We will also provide different gestures for different activities like double tap for voice command mode activation for general calling and messaging.
The output of the app will be in the speech format i.e. any output that is shown on the screen of the app, will also be converted into speech and spoken back to the user.
The UI of the app will be very basic because most of the app is working on gestures.
